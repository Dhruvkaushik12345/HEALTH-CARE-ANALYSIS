Healthcare Data Preparation & Validation

Project Overview & Objective
Field	Detail
Project Title	Healthcare Patient Records: Initial ETL and Data Hygiene
Sector	Health Analytics - Patient Management & Administration
Status	Data Ready for Exploratory Analysis (EDA) or Modeling
Objective	To create a validated, de-duplicated dataset of patient records to serve as the reliable foundation for subsequent analysis, such as predicting readmission rates or optimizing resource allocation.
Key Output	healthcare_cleaned.csv (De-duplicated patient records).

Data Source & Preparation (ETL Details)
This section documents the source data and the Extract-Transform-Load process performed by the HEALTH CARE CLEANING.py script.
Data Source
•	Original File: healthcare_dataset.csv
•	Timeframe: (To be filled in post-analysis, but assumed to be recent operational data).
•	Key Features Columns: The dataset comprises {15} columns of patient administrative and clinical data, including:
o	Demographics: Age, Gender, Blood Type
o	Clinical: Medical Condition, Medication, Test Results
o	Administrative: Date of Admission, Discharge Date, Admission Type, Room Number, Billing Amount, Insurance Provider



Transformation Logic (The "T" in ETL)
•	The cleaning process was executed using Python with the pandas library, as detailed in HEALTH CARE CLEANING.py.
Step Rationale	Python Implementation

Duplicate Removal	Ensures data integrity and prevents bias overweighting of specific patient records in subsequent statistical modeling.	df = df.drop_duplicates()

Missing Value Inspection	Initial check performed to identify rows with all critical fields (Room Number, Age, Billing Amount) missing.	Code identified potential missing values but no imputation removal was applied in the final script. This is noted as a Future Work item.
Data Export	Final cleaned data persisted for use in the analysis phase.	df.to_csv("Healthcare Cleaned_Data.csv")

KEY INSIGHTS 

Length of Stay (LOS):
•	Insight Goal: Pinpoint theMedical Conditions and Admission Types that consistently result in the longest patient stays.
•	Action: This informs resource allocation (staffing, bed capacity) and allows the hospital to develop targeted discharge planning protocols for high-LOS conditions to improve patient flow and efficiency.
Billing Anomaly & Payer Risk:
•	Insight Goal: Identify any specific Insurance Providers or Medical Condition pairings where the average Billing Amount is a significant outlier (high or low) compared to the overall dataset mean.
•	Action: This triggers immediate financial review to investigate potential coding errors, payment discrepancies, or negotiate better rates with high-cost low-reimbursement payers.
Medication-Test Outcome Correlation:
•	Insight Goal: Determine if there is a statistically significant link between the prescribed Medication and a final Test Result of "Abnormal" or "Inconclusive."
•	Action: This is a crucial Quality of Care metric that could necessitate a review of existing clinical protocols or medication efficacy for certain patient groups.
